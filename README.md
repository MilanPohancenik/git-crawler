This application is intendet to illustrate the usage of an external GitHub client in a hexagonal architecture. 
It is divided into [backend](/backend/) and [frontend](/frontend/), but currently it has no frontend available. This app can evolve over time. 

More documentation can be found in the respective parts of the app. The app has no automatic build and deployment currently, but it may be added!
