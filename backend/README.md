## Building and running the project

wrapper, which downloads gradle and builds the project.

### Commands

`gradle clean build`

To start the project, you don't need any docker images etc. Just run `gradle bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=local` or even with building it before like
`gradle clean build bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=local`. The profile currently doesn't do anything, but it's there to illustrate the possibility :)

### Using personal github token
You can  pass in your github personal user token via env variable `export GIT_HUB_AUTHORIZATION=your-personal-token` before running the app. This will automatically
activate the authorization an run with higher rate limiters. Please note, that this app uses the search API, which may use different rate limiting
than the rest and therefore can run into 500 error codes on the backend. If you see any logs regarding the rate limiting, 
then lower the amount of fetched records in the requests.
